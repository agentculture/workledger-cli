# CLAUDE.md — seed / bootstrap placeholder

## Agent

This repository hosts the **workledger-cli** agent.

## Description

Tracks work in a ledger so agents can prove what they did. An agent records its work as append-only ledger entries, hands the ledger down to subagents, and gets it back with their entries folded in, so the whole tree of work and its results stays traceable and checkable.

## Re-init instruction

This file is a seed. To expand it into your full runtime prompt:

1. Open this repo in Claude Code (or your preferred AI assistant).
2. Run `/init` — the assistant will read the repo, incorporate the description
   above, and replace this seed with a complete `CLAUDE.md`.
3. Commit the result.

Until you run `/init`, `workledger-cli` satisfies the `steward doctor`
`prompt-file-present` and `backend-consistency` invariants (a `CLAUDE.md`
exists and `culture.yaml` declares `backend: claude`) but the prompt is not
yet tailored to this agent's domain.
