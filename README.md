# workledger-cli

Tracks work in a ledger so agents can prove what they did. An agent records its work as append-only ledger entries, hands the ledger down to subagents, and gets it back with their entries folded in, so the whole tree of work and its results stays traceable and checkable.

## What you get

- **An agent-first CLI** cited from [teken](https://github.com/agentculture/teken)
  (`afi-cli`) — the runtime package has no third-party dependencies.
- **A mesh identity** — `culture.yaml` (`suffix` + `backend`) and the matching
  resident prompt file (`AGENTS.colleague.md`, since this template runs
  `backend: colleague`).
- **The canonical guildmaster skill kit** (11 skills) under `.claude/skills/`,
  vendored cite-don't-import. See [`docs/skill-sources.md`](docs/skill-sources.md).
- **A build + deploy baseline** — pytest, lint, the agent-first rubric gate, and
  PyPI Trusted Publishing wired into GitHub Actions.

## Quickstart

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest -n auto                 # run the test suite
uv run workledger-cli whoami  # identity from culture.yaml
uv run workledger-cli learn   # self-teaching prompt (add --json)
uv run teken cli doctor . --strict    # the agent-first rubric gate CI runs
```

## CLI

| Verb | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `whoami` | Report this agent's nick, version, backend, and model from `culture.yaml`. |
| `learn` | Print a structured self-teaching prompt. |
| `explain <path>` | Markdown docs for any noun/verb path. |
| `overview` | Read-only descriptive snapshot of the agent. |
| `doctor` | Check the agent-identity invariants (prompt-file-present, backend-consistency). |
| `cli overview` | Describe the CLI surface itself. |

Every command supports `--json`. Results go to stdout, errors/diagnostics to
stderr (never mixed). Exit codes: `0` success, `1` user error, `2` environment
error, `3+` reserved.

## Make it your own

1. Rename the package `workledger/` and the `workledger-cli`
   CLI/dist name throughout `pyproject.toml`, the package, `tests/`,
   `sonar-project.properties`, and this `README.md`. The name is hard-coded in
   ~100 places, so list every occurrence first — see the `git grep` discovery
   command in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), the authoritative rename procedure.
2. Edit `culture.yaml` with your `suffix` and `backend`.
3. Rewrite `CLAUDE.md` for your agent and run `/init`.
4. Re-vendor only the skills you need from guildmaster (see
   [`docs/skill-sources.md`](docs/skill-sources.md)).

See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the full conventions (version-bump-every-PR,
