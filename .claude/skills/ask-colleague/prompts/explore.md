$ARGUMENTS

Rules:
- This is READ-ONLY. Use read_file, list_dir, and read-only run_command only
  (e.g. `git log`, `git grep`, `ls`, `rg`). Do NOT create, modify, or delete any
  file, and do NOT run any command that changes state.
- Be concrete: cite file paths and line numbers; quote the key code you rely on.
- Surface what's surprising, risky, or unclear — not just a tidy summary.
- Search efficiently: don't repeat near-identical searches — once a search
  points you at the relevant file, READ it instead of re-grepping for synonyms.
- You have a limited step budget, and a report that never calls `finish` returns
  NOTHING — wasting the whole drive. The moment you have enough to write a useful
  report (or you are within a few steps of the budget), STOP reading and call
  `finish`. Err on the side of finishing early — a focused finding beats endless
  reading.

When you are done, call finish with a structured findings report:
1. What it is / how it works (with file:line references).
2. Notable details, edge cases, or surprises.
3. Open questions or risks worth a closer look.
