#!/usr/bin/env bash
# assign-to-workforce.sh — fan out devague plan waves to parallel agents.
#
# The skill is named `assign-to-workforce`; it reads `devague plan waves`
# (scheduling metadata produced by the /spec-to-plan skill) and renders the
# implementation split plan: task map + per-task agent/model proposal + a
# go/no-go prompt for the human. The actual fan-out (worktree creation,
# spawning, TDD-gated merges) is performed by the operator/main agent once
# the human approves the split plan.
#
# The devague CLI is non-orchestrating (#20): `devague plan waves` describes
# the dependency graph; it does not spawn agents, manage worktrees, or pick
# a backend. This wrapper is the operator-facing helper.
#
# Origin: authored and maintained in agentculture/devague. steward pulls this
# skill from here and broadcasts it to the rest of the AgentCulture mesh, so
# it is written to run anywhere — portable bash, no devague-checkout assumptions.
#
# Plans persist under .devague/ in the current directory, so run from the repo
# you are implementing.

assign-to-workforce.sh — fan out devague plan waves to parallel agents.

Usage:
  assign-to-workforce.sh split-plan [--plan <slug>]   print the implementation split plan
  assign-to-workforce.sh waves      [--plan <slug>] [--json]   list dependency waves
  assign-to-workforce.sh help                         this help

Commands:
  split-plan   Read `devague plan waves --json` and render the human-facing
               implementation split plan: task map + per-task agent/model
               proposal + go/no-go. Present this to the human before any
               fan-out; do not proceed without approval.
  waves        Forward `devague plan waves` (and any extra flags) verbatim.
               On a converged plan exits 0 and lists the dependency waves.

Plans persist under .devague/ in the current directory — run from the repo
you are implementing. Results go to stdout, diagnostics to stderr.

Human gates (three only):
  1. The exported spec (already closed by the /think leg).
  2. This implementation split plan (go/no-go to assign to workforce).
  3. The final PR (opened by the main agent via `cicd` / `devex pr open`).

The devague CLI is non-orchestrating (#20): `devague plan waves` describes
the graph; the operator performs the fan-out. One worktree per task; TDD
gates every merge (tests pass before AND after merge); no human per task.
